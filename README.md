 There is three folders in here.
 1. backend
 2. front-end
 3. order-app

befor Excution, please install mysql and goto back-end and find 'setting_const.js' and fix currectly as you computer.
if you are running and one coputer you just type 'localhost:5000', and 'localhost: 8080'.
if running on server fix as you setted


First, Excution `yarn install` and `yarn start` backend.
Second, Excution `yarn install` and `yarn start` at front-end
third, Excution `yarn install` and `yarn start` at order-app and it will you 'do you want to use anthor port?' then do Y
" so second and third should working on 3000 and 3001 each.

And now open the each folders and open src folders again and there will be configs.js
so you should change the ip as your server (5000 is for http api) (8080 is for socket io)
